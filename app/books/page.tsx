        read." - Naval Ravikant

        Iâ€™m an avid reader. Even on the busiest of days, I always make time to
        pickup a good book. By reading, anyone can engage in personal
        conversation with the greatest people in history.

        Classical literature by authors like Oscar Wilde and Ayn Rand is among
        my favorites. But I'm particularly drawn to real-life non-fiction works
        by authors such as Brian Tracy, Naval Ravikant, MJ Demarco, and David
        Goggins.

        In the realm of modern literature, I find joy in the captivating
        storytelling of Haruki Murakami and the thought-provoking writings of
        Jordan Peterson.
