        "I swear by my life and my love of it that I will never live for the
        sake of another person, nor ask anyone to live for mine." - John Galt

      <p>
        My heroes are the people who have the power to shape the worldâ€”the
        inventors, entrepreneurs, and leaders who inspire greatness. I admire
        their ability to create extraordinary things and surpass ordinary
        limits.
      </p>
      <p>Here are some of my heroes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Naval Ravikant</li>
        <li>Francisco D'Aconia</li>
        <li>Henry Rearden</li>
        <li>Elon Musk</li>
        <li>Bobby Fischer</li>
        <li>Hamza Ahmed</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I am dedicated to achieving greatness in my own life and aspire to join
        these legendary figures in making a lasting impact on the world.
